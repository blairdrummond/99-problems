Project Euler problems in many languages

Problems from:  https://projecteuler.net/archives

Only the Haskell problems are verified (They're the only ones that I really pay attention to).

14.hs is still very slow. I need to work on it. I'm going to see if parallelizing does the trick.

18.hs is my favorite piece so far (It should be good enough to handle the upcoming problem 67)
